            analysis of interviews, where we gathered similar needs and then, I facilitated a group brainstorming
            session. This process helped generate a greater range of ideas and answers to How-Might-We questions as
            well as helped to uncover great opportunities during the development of CJM

            for the initial concept were defined. As the next step, I created the draft concept and started a long
            journey of validating it. Several iterations after when all the stakeholders were convinced that the
            solution covers all the key scenarios, it validated with end-users, converted to the development backlog

            Fast delivery, established contact with a customer, and design process â€” all of that had an influence on

            2 FTEs
